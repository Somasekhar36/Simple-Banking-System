This code implements a simple banking system using C++. 
It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and view account summaries. 
Each account has a unique number, type, ownerâ€™s name, and balance. 
Input validation is handled to ensure accurate data entry, and the system is menu-driven, enabling users to interact through a clear set of options. 
The code uses a `map` to manage multiple accounts efficiently, ensuring quick access and updates.
